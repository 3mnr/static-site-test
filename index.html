<h3 id="headline">Birth - 63 B.C</h3>
<p id="content-text">
    Octavius was born in Rome, but was raised in his family's home in the town of
    Velletri due to Rome being overcrowded at the time. His father (Gaius Octavius) 
    was a senator and governor and unfortunately passed away while Octavius was only
    four years old. He continuously fell ill during his childhood and was considered
    a weak child.

<h3 id="headline">Early Adult Life</h3>
<p id="content-text">
    Octavius was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 B.C once he became of adult
    age. Octavius wanted to join his uncle Julius Caesar's staff for his campaign in 
    Africa during 47 B.C but was persuaded not to by his mother, Atia. His time came in
    46 B.C when he went to join Caesar in Hispania where he planned to fight the forces
    of Pompey. Octavius became ill but recovered and set sail before becoming
    shipwrecked. Once he had made it to shore with some companions, he managed to avoid
    enemy patrols and cross through enemy territory to reach Caesar. After learning
    this, Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage, and once returned to Rome
    changed his will to name Octavius as his heir. Octavius went to study and undergo
    military training at Apollonia in Illyria.

<p id="content-text">
    Caesar was assasinated on 15 March 44 B.C. During this time Octavius was studying
    and going through military training at Illyria. His peers advised him to stay away
    from Italy but nevertheless Octavius travelled to Rome. It was upon his arrival
    that he learned of Caesar's will and decided to assume his uncle's name Gaius
    Julius Caesar. Octavius used money allotted by Caesar for a future Parthia
    campaign to raise troops. Octavius then also took the annual tribute that had been 
    sent from Rome's Near Eastern province. Soon his army was filled with Caesar's 
    veteran legionaries. He amassed support by emphasizing his status as heir to 
    Caesar. He marched through Italy attracting support and won over more veterans 
    stationed at Campania. He soon had 3,000 loyal veterans.
